  -0:Every single label is not a function or a subroutine. A subroutine is any group of code that executes the ‘ret’ instruction at the end. Like a function that jumps back to where it started when it completes. A subroutine starts with a label but often will have other labels inside of it. ************In the future you will be docked for not including main and any subroutines you have and you will be docked for putting excessive labels in your code
